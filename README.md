Technologies Used:
    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript

Getting Started:
    Click on each tile, and look for matching pairs.  
    Once pairs have been found, there will be a check mark.
    Once all pairs have been found, you win!

Next Steps:
    The following are planned features:
        -A timer for when the game starts, that will stop once the last pair is found.
        -A score counter, so show how many attempts it takes to find all pairs.
        -Buttons to change difficulty, which will change the size of the game board.
